</p>

1) As of right now, vanish support is only available on *BungeeCord/Waterfall*. The plugin will still function as normal, but if you go into vanish then it won't send a fake join/leave message.
1) In order for prefixes and suffixes to work, you **must** have LuckPerms installed on the proxy. Then, you can use `%prefix%` and `%suffix%`.
1) `%epoch%` and the timestamps only work in certain places on Discord. As an alternative, you can select some of the embeds to have `use-timestamp: true`. This is out of my control sadly... ðŸ˜”
